# How to Rebuild Dev Container from Command Line

Since the "Rebuild Container" menu option is missing, you can manage the container using the command line on your **host machine**.

## Prerequisites

You need the **Dev Container CLI**.
If you have `npm` installed on your host, install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

## Rebuild Command

To rebuild and start the container (this will force a recreation, effectively a rebuild):

```bash
# Run this from the root of your project workspace on the host
devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container
```

This command reads your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, rebuilds the Docker image if necessary, and starts the container.

## About Container Names

The `vsc-gym-...` name you see is automatically generated by the Dev Container engine to ensure uniqueness across different projects.

While `devcontainer.json` has `"runArgs": ["--name=gym"]`, the IDE integration often overrides or spaces this to avoid conflicts.

To strictly force a specific container name (e.g., `gym-apps`) and avoid the `vsc-` prefix, the most reliable method is to use **Docker Compose**.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Set `container_name: gym-apps` in the service definition.
3. Update `devcontainer.json` to use `"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml"` instead of `"dockerfile"`.

However, if you just want to rebuild, the `devcontainer up` command above is the direct solution.
