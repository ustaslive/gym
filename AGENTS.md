# Language Policy

- **English-only content**: All code, documentation, and comments must be written in English.
- **Applies regardless of chat language**: This rule holds no matter what language is used in conversations or any other context.
- **Exceptions by explicit instruction**: Use a non‑English language only when there is a clear, explicit instruction to do so.
- **Preserve existing non‑English**: If existing code/docs/comments are already in a non‑English language, do not change them unless explicitly instructed.
- **Developer chat language**: Communicate with the developer in the same language used in their requests, while keeping all code, docs, and comments in English.

This policy ensures consistency and clarity across the codebase and documentation while remaining responsive and accessible in developer conversations.
